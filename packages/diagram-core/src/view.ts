/**
 * View documents and occurrences (SPEC 3.4).
 *
 * An OCCURRENCE is a drawing of a semantic element in one view. The same entity
 * has N occurrences in one view and occurrences in several views; drawing it
 * twice does not duplicate the entity (study invariant 2). Removing an
 * occurrence removes a drawing, nothing else. Removing the ENTITY demands an
 * explicit policy for its occurrences and relations - `commands.ts` has no
 * default for it.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN a view: occurrences, visual groups, view filters and the
 * PERSISTABLE presentation state. WHAT IS OUT: transient state (hover, the
 * in-flight drag, the current marquee) and any duplicate of business data. A
 * view stores no attribute of an entity: it points at the entity.
 *
 * All three occurrence maps share ONE `occurrence:` identity namespace, so an
 * occurrence id is unique across the three (checked as `duplicate-id`).

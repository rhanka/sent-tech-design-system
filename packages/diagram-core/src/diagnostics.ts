/**
 * Diagnostics: every refusal in this package names itself.
 *
 * The rule the whole package follows is that a rejection is USELESS unless the
 * caller can tell WHY, WHERE and ABOUT WHAT. So there is no boolean validity
 * anywhere: validation returns diagnostics, and a transaction that refuses
 * returns the diagnostics that made it refuse. The nine named rejected cases of
 * SPEC 3.7 are nine codes below, and each one is asserted by a test against a
 * fixture - the test asserts the CODE, not merely the failure.
